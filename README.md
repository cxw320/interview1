# fluttersimtest_app1

This is a basic flutter application that generates word pairs to come up with startup names. 
As the first step in your interview, we ask that you be able to run this project on both an iOS simulator as well as an Android simulator on your personal computer. 
You will be asked to show your simulators running this application at the start of your interview before proceeding to the next step.

If you already have your flutter toolchain set up, clone this repo, cd into the project and type the command `flutter run` before the start of your interview and have one or both of your simulators running the application. 

If you don't have a flutter toolchain set up follow step one below. 

## Step One for Interviewers - Set up a flutter toolchain on your computer. 

#1: 
In order to set up your flutter toolchain correctly, visit: 
- [Set up your toolchain](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

- Follow these steps at minimum to get your test application up and running: 
1. -[Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. -[Set up an editor](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor)
3. -[Test Drive](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive)

Have your "Test Drive" application up and running at the start of your interview. It should look like this:

For this interview process, you will need to be able to open the project in any or all of the following editors: 
XCode, 
VSCode, 
Android Studio

Please be prepared to open the project IN ANY OR ALL of these editors.

Part Two of your interivew will be based on a series of questions relating to common problems faced in dart/flutter cross-platform development.
We will walk through a simple flutter application in real time for Part Two of your interview.
